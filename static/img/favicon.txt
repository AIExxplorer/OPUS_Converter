To create a favicon for the OPUS Converter application:

1. Visit a favicon generator website like https://favicon.io/
2. Create a simple icon with the letter "O" or a music note
3. Download the generated favicon.ico file
4. Place it in this directory (static/img/)

Alternatively, you can use any image editing software to create a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixel icon and save it as favicon.ico.
